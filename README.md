# CSRF-Vulnerability 
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of web security vulnerability that allows attackers to trick victims into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated. In simpler terms, it's a way for an attacker to make your web browser do something you didn't intend to do, even if you're logged into a trusted website.

# Here are some of the things an attacker could do with a successful CSRF attack:
  ● Transfer money out of your bank account
  ● Change your password
  ● Post embarrassing content on your social media accounts
  ● Buy items on your online shopping car

# How CSRF attacks work:
There are two main ways that CSRF attacks can be carried out:
  1. Tricking the victim into clicking on a malicious link: The attacker can send the victim a link that, when clicked, sends a forged request to the targeted website. The link could be embedded in an email, social media post, or even a seemingly harmless image.
  2. Embedding malicious code on a website: The attacker can embed malicious code on awebsite that the victim is likely to visit. This code can then send a forged request to the targeted website without the victim's knowledge or consent


# How it can Add New Admin Victim Company Profile: 
      Step 1: Open Burp's browser and log in to your account. Submit the "add admin" form, and find the resulting request in your Proxy history.
      Step 2: If you're using Burp Suite Professional, right-click on the request and select Engagement tools / Generate CSRF PoC.
      Step 3: Alternatively, if you're using Burp Suite Community Edition, use the following "https://tools.nakanosec.com/csrf/" just submit the "POST" request it will be convert into hrml. 
      Step 4:  Send the file to victim when victim click this file you will be admin of the victim company.
