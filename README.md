# CSRF-Vulnerability
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of web security vulnerability that allows attackers to trick victims into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated. In simpler terms, it's a way for an attacker to make your web browser do something you didn't intend to do, even if you're logged into a trusted website.

# Here are some of the things an attacker could do with a successful CSRF attack:
● Transfer money out of your bank account
● Change your password
● Post embarrassing content on your social media accounts
● Buy items on your online shopping car

# How CSRF attacks work:
There are two main ways that CSRF attacks can be carried out:
1. Tricking the victim into clicking on a malicious link: The attacker can send the victim a
link that, when clicked, sends a forged request to the targeted website. The link could be
embedded in an email, social media post, or even a seemingly harmless image.
2. Embedding malicious code on a website: The attacker can embed malicious code on a
website that the victim is likely to visit. This code can then send a forged request to the
targeted website without the victim's knowledge or consent
